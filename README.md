# flight-screen-info
Will end up being a little flask site that provides the departure schedule of whatever airport you choose (like they do in real airports)

# API : 
This program uses the API of Flightaware.
Said API requires an API key. More info [here](https://www.flightaware.com/commercial/aeroapi)

# Config.py :
The example file needs to be copied as config.py. There, you can configure the API key and airport that interests you.
